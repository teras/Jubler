 *
 * \brief Advanced blur-based logo removing filter.

 *     Hello and welcome. This code implements a filter to remove annoying TV
 * logos and other annoying images placed onto a video stream. It works by filling
 * in the pixels that comprise the logo with neighboring pixels. The transform is
 * very loosely based on a gaussian blur, but it is different enough to merit its
 * own paragraph later on. It is a major improvement on the old delogo filter as
 * it both uses a better blurring algorithm and uses a bitmap to use an arbitrary
 * and generally much tighter fitting shape than a rectangle.
 *
 *     The filter requires 1 argument and has no optional arguments. It requires
 * a filter bitmap, which must be in PGM or PPM format. A sample invocation would
 * be -vf remove_logo=/home/username/logo_bitmaps/xyz.pgm.  Pixels with a value of
 * zero are not part of the logo, and non-zero pixels are part of the logo. If you
 * use white (255) for the logo and black (0) for the rest, you will be safe. For
 * making the filter bitmap, I recommend taking a screen capture of a black frame
 * with the logo visible, and then using The GIMP's threshold filter followed by
 * the erode filter once or twice. If needed, little splotches can be fixed
 * manually. Remember that if logo pixels are not covered, the filter quality will
 * be much reduced. Marking too many pixels as part of the logo doesn't hurt as
 * much, but it will increase the amount of blurring needed to cover over the
 * image and will destroy more information than necessary. Additionally, this blur
 * algorithm is O(n) = n^4, where n is the width and height of a hypothetical
 * square logo, so extra pixels will slow things down on a large lo
 *
 *     The logo removal algorithm has two key points. The first is that it
 * distinguishes between pixels in the logo and those not in the logo by using the
 * passed-in bitmap. Pixels not in the logo are copied over directly without being
 * modified and they also serve as source pixels for the logo fill-in. Pixels
 * inside the logo have the mask applied.
 *
 *     At init-time the bitmap is reprocessed internally, and the distance to the
 * nearest edge of the logo (Manhattan distance), along with a little extra to
 * remove rough edges, is stored in each pixel. This is done using an in-place
 * erosion algorithm, and incrementing each pixel that survives any given erosion.
 * Once every pixel is eroded, the maximum value is recorded, and a set of masks
 * from size 0 to this size are generaged. The masks are circular binary masks,
 * where each pixel within a radius N (where N is the size of the mask) is a 1,
 * and all other pixels are a 0. Although a gaussian mask would be more
 * mathematically accurate, a binary mask works better in practice because we
 * generally do not use the central pixels in the mask (because they are in the
 * logo region), and thus a gaussian mask will cause too little blur and thus a
 * very unstable image.
 *
 *     The mask is applied in a special way. Namely, only pixels in the mask that
 * line up to pixels outside the logo are used. The dynamic mask size means that
 * the mask is just big enough so that the edges touch pixels outside the logo, so
 * the blurring is kept to a minimum and at least the first boundary condition is
 * met (that the image function itself is continuous), even if the second boundary
 * condition (that the derivative of the image function is continuous) is not met.
 * A masking algorithm that does preserve the second boundary coundition
 * (perhaps something based on a highly-modified bi-cubic algorithm) should offer
 * even better results on paper, but the noise in a typical TV signal should make
 * anything based on derivatives hopelessly noisy.
